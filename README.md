Just walked out of seeing Warfare, and honestly, I'm somewhere between exhausted and bewildered. First of all, the dude behind me kept coughing like he was auditioning for a plague   — so that was distracting. But the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮... wow. It's like someone took a blender to my brain and said, “Here, have some chaos.” The action scenes were all punch and sparkle, like confetti in a hurricane, and I mean that both as a compliment and a cry for help. 

777 

The opening scene?! I don’t know whether to call it epic or a caffeine overdose in 30 seconds of footage. I was definitely nooding off, maybe, I might've dozed here and there, but give me a break — too much intensity to laugh, too many bullets to cry! The sound was so loud it felt like my eardrums were training for a strongman competition. The main character — who, might I say, looks like he’s missed a few sunscreen tutorials — is running around, saving the world one awkwardly delivered line at a time. Gotta admit, the soundtrack was banging though. Throw it on Spotify and I might forgive the relentless whisper of war whistles in my ears. 

The storyline? Held together by the thinnest thread — like floss, after a whole feast. But hey, who’s 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ing Warfare for an intellectual renaissance? It's all guns, betrayal, and maybe some existential angst if you squint between explosions. There was this one scene when I legit thought they’d play a hidden Mariah Carey track for the big emotional twist (but maybe the caffeine deprivation's just hitting hard). 

Randomly, I couldn't help but think, if you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in a comfy couch-pile, it might make more sense. Also, shout out to that wild desert combat scene that felt more like a rave party with automatic rifles — sparks flying like spitting rain. Like, did they choreograph that with mirror balls and a dance floor? 

Here's a bit of nonsense for ya, maybe it makes sense in the world of Warfare, who knows: 

csharp
int soldiers = 7;
int tanks = soldiers  13;
if (enemySpotted)
{
    soldiers--;
}


Anywho, if you fancy a mix of exhaustion and perplexity, maybe go catch Warfare in theaters. Or don’t. Might want to wait, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later to question reality in your own chaotic space. My head's already replaying that absurd finale where the antagonist suddenly had the world’s worst timing for a villainous monologue. I felt like I just stepped off a rollercoaster that went off track halfway through. Time for some peace & concealer.
